# Random Walk Simulation

## Overview
This project is a Python script that simulates a **Random Walk** process. A Random Walk is a mathematical model that describes a path consisting of a sequence of random steps. It is widely used in various fields such as physics, finance, biology, and computer science to model random processes.

## Features
- Simulates Random Walks in one or two dimensions.
- Adjustable parameters such as the number of steps and step size.
- Visualizes the Random Walk with matplotlib for 1D and 2D simulations.

## Requirements
To run this script, you need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Open the script in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
3. Modify the parameters as needed (e.g., number of steps, distance of steps).
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python random_walk.py
   ```

## Parameters
You can customize the following parameters in the script:
- **`num_steps`**: Total number of steps in the Random Walk (default: 1000).
- **`step_size`**: The size of each step (default: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]).

## Example
Below is an example of a 2D Random Walk with 1000 steps:
```python
num_steps = 1000
step_size = 1
```
The script will generate and display a 2D plot of the Random Walk.

## Output
- **1D Walk**: A line plot representing the position over time.
- **2D Walk**: A scatter or line plot showing the trajectory in a plane.

## Visualization
The script uses `matplotlib` for visualizing the Random Walk. Examples of plots include:
- A zigzagging line for 1D walks.
- A wandering path for 2D walks.
- A twisting trajectory for 3D walks. (soon)
